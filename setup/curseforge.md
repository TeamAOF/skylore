## CurseForge App (Windows / Mac)
1. Download the [CurseForge App](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

2. Download and put the folder of the cursforge instance of your choice in the Instances folder, the default path is `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curseforge\Minecraft\Instances`.

* Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be `C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances`.
3. Double click the script sync.ps1 everytime you want to update the modpack.

4. Open the CurseForge App and you should see the modpack. If you already had CurseForge App open, restart it.
